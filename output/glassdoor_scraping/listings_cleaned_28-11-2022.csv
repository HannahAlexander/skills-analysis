The University of Nottinghamï¿½s Digital Research Service (DRS) is a dedicated, core facility of Research Software Engineers (RSE) that supports the entire research community in Nottingham by providing expertise and capabilities in the areas of Data Analytics/Data Science, Bioinformatics and Software Development (including High Performance Computing). Our team of 25 interdisciplinary experts make the DRS one of the UKï¿½s largest RSE groups.

 The DRS has a proven track record of enabling, improving and impacting research on projects ranging from small proof of concept studies with a handful of data points to large national data infrastructure projects such as the UKCRC Tissue Directory and Coordination Centre and COCONNECT. Over the course of the academic year 2021/2022, the DRS team have successfully completed over 60 projects from a wide range of research domains, including research projects in collaboration with industry partners. Furthermore, the expertise within the DRS has attracted commercial partnerships with the NHS, local government, and businesses in finance, advertising, social housing, transportation and retail.

 The DRS offers unrivalled exposure to commercial and research projects from different domains, allowing team members to acquire a diverse set of project experience in a relatively short amount of time.

 The successful candidate for this role will join a high-performing team of experts in a nationally recognised facility to provide bespoke, project-based support to improve the quality of research at the University of Nottingham. We are looking for an individual that can perform in a high-paced environment and consistently deliver on multiple projects and deadlines in parallel. The ability to adapt approaches for technical solutions, as well as the dissemination and communication of results for each project to suit the particular needs of the research domain is also key for this role.

 We are looking for a candidate with experience in Data Science, including advanced statistics, database systems, machine learning and basic understanding of software engineering agile methodologies. Knowledge of Python, R or Matlab is essential for the role.

 This position is offered on a fixed term basis for 12 months. Hours are part-time (20 hours per week).

About us
UCL established the Institute of Health Informatics (IHI) in August 2014 in the Faculty of Population Health Sciences, under the leadership of Professor Harry Hemingway. The Institute of Health Informatics is part of the UCL Faculty of Population Health Sciences, which is part of the School of Life and Medical Sciences. The aim of the Institute of Health Informatics is to conduct high quality research that leverages big data and health and bioinformatics approaches to improve health at local, national and international levels. During the pandemic IHI research has informed policy in cancer services, public understanding of risk and in care homes. Our cutting edge programmes of research span the areas of Discovery Science, Precision Medicine, Learning Health Systems, Public Health and Citizen Driven Health. These programmes of research are underpinned by: excellent secure data infrastructure; adding value to key linked data resources to make data research-ready; development of multidisciplinary methodological expertise; engagement with patients, the public and health services; strong local, national and international academic partnerships and excellent multidisciplinary training programmes. The Institute leads major programmes within the recently announced, 5-year, ï¿½90m NIHR UCLH/UCL Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), CALIBER, Health Data Research UK (HDR UK), Genomics England Electronic Health Records Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP), Big Data@Heart, among others.
About the role
In this role you will be generating estimates of occurrence (prevalence, incidence) and outcome (including standardised mortality and morbidity ratios, years of life lost), developing, validating and reporting risk prediction models at scale using regression based and machine learning approaches, designing and analysing ï¿½diseasomeï¿½-wide association studies, iteratively generating re-usable data visualisation (e.g. scatter, Circos, Manhattan plots) pipelines, building sustainable analytical pipelines/developing code that can be readily used by others, maintained and extended.

The post is funded until 31 March 2025.

701,Barclays,4.0,Operations Degree Apprenticeship 2023,"Liverpool, England",Company - Public (BARC),Banking & Lending,"Youï¿½ll get the opportunity to earn while you learn, gaining a degree in Data Science with with a top university at the same time in a permanent job. A unique chance to get a degree qualification without the student loan, all whilst getting 4 years of work experience under your belt. Your studies will allow you to explore the theoretical learning of Data Science, from statistics and data analytics through to programming and data visualisation. Your role within Operations will give you the opportunity to apply your theoretical learning to real-life impactful work thatï¿½s central to the success of the bank. Weï¿½ve spent 11 years perfecting the support that youï¿½ll receive on our Apprenticeship programme. That starts with our market-leading Talent Coach model: from day one, youï¿½ll be assigned a talent coach matched to your needs and background, and together with your line manager, theyï¿½ll support you as an individual. Weï¿½ll also match you to an expert in your specialist subject, ready to share their knowledge. The Apprenticeship route gives you the opportunity for self-discovery and helps you to explore different career paths. With over 325 years of expertise in Banking, Barclays operates in over 40 countries, employing over 80,000 people to help move, lend, invest and protect money for customers and clients worldwide.

About us
The mission of the UCL GOS Institute of Child Health is to improve the health and well-being of children, and the adults they will become, through world-class research, education and public engagement. The UCL GOS ICH, together with its clinical partner Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, forms the largest concentration of childrenï¿½s health research outside North America. GOS ICHï¿½s activities include active engagement with children and families, to ensure that our work is relevant and appropriate to their needs. GOS ICH generates the funding for our research by setting out our proposals in high quality applications to public, charitable and industrial funding bodies and disseminates the results of our research by publication in the medical and scientific literature, to clinicians, policy makers and the wider public. The Institute offers world-class education and training across a wide range of teaching and life learning programmes which address the needs of students and professional groups who are interested in and undertaking work relevant to child health.
About the role
This post offers an excellent career development opportunity for a Research Fellow trained in quantitative methods, epidemiology or data science and an interest in conducting research to inform policies to improve the health of children and young people. The post is based within the Population Policy and Practice Programme (PPP) at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (UCLGOSICH) and is funded for three years in the first instance. The post holder will be responsible for leading a programme of work to: i) improve our understanding of the burden of childhood obesity. ii) develop an existing public health model to estimate the impact of local government anti-obesity policies on childrenï¿½s health. The post is available from 1 February 2023.
About you
The post holder will be expected to have significant expertise in public health data science, epidemiology and/or quantitative method. They should be able to work independently and collaboratively as part of a wider team. The Research Fellow will have excellent research and analytical skills and demonstrable organisational and multidisciplinary teamworking abilities. An awareness of public or child health issues would be an advantage, but are not essential.
