BSc/BA in Computer Science, Engineering or relevant field; graduate degree in Data Science or other quantitative field is preferred 
Previous experience with biometric algorithms is a plus 
Integrity. You have an unwavering commitment to ‘confronting the grey’ in all areas of your work, and encourage transparency in all your interactions. 
Problem-solving. You understand the importance of rigorously detailed data, and have a strong ability to synthesise complex and potentially competing requirements, and convert them into recommendations that drive impact decisions. 
Curiosity. You have the desire to think innovatively and explore and understand how different perspectives and complex data blend together to create the bigger picture and context. 
Learning. You love learning new things, like to share what you learn, and can pick up new tools and methods quickly. 
Grit. You have a hands-on, can-do attitude and the drive to dig deep into problems to discover pain points and features from multiple perspectives, and the resilience to stay focused on a project to the end. 
Passion. If being part of a team that designs and deploys technology for global health sounds exciting, we want to meet you! 
Genuine Impact. Work directly with our partners and users to deliver technology that has the potential to impact millions of lives. 
Incredible, diverse team. Ask any “Simployee” what their favourite thing about working at Simprints is, and the answer is likely to be “the people.” Our work is at the intersection of technology and global development, and we’ve managed to build an amazing team drawn from all over the world. But don’t take our word for it, we’re an externally recognised Great Place to Work and 2022 Best Workplace for Women 
Career Advancement. Join the top leadership team of a forward thinking social enterprise that is already pushing the boundaries of people leadership, with initiatives like unlimited PTO and progressive maternity/paternity leave. 
Flexible hours. More efficient late at night? Better before the sun rises? That’s fine by us. We are looking for people who get the job done, not for people who work between 9am and 5pm. 
Professional development and wellbeing. We promote continual learning with self-directed learning objectives, external mentors, and regular one-on-one feedback. We also put our money where our mouth is with a dedicated ‘Learning ’ budget, and access to global experts though the GLG network. 
Unlimited paid time off. We set high standards and goals, but give people the freedom to choose when and how to recharge. Join a team that trusts you with the job. 
Submit your CV at www.simprints.com/careers. We will then undertake shortlisting and arrange an initial 10-20 minute call with suitable candidates. Following this we will follow up with a technical assessment. Not everyone is great at face-to-face interviews, and we want to make sure that you have the best chance to show yourself off in the best light. 
Submit the technical assessment. Once we’ve received your completed assessment, they will be blinded to avoid any bias and given to a panel of reviewers to be scored independently. Top-scoring applicants will then be invited to a video interview. 
The interview is an opportunity to understand your motivations for joining Simprints, assess your cultural and technical fit, and provide you with a chance to ask any questions you have about the role and company. 
After the interview we plan to invite one or two candidates to a virtual digital experience half-day. The experience day is intended to ensure that Simprints is as good a fit for you as you are for us. You’ll have a chance to meet some of the team and demonstrate your skills in a few more technical exercises that simulate what it’s like to work as a data scientist at Simprints.",www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=230&ao=1136043&s=58&guid=00000186f3ced7d1903ffc1888c679ff&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_bb67ba5d&cb=1679127664894&jobListingId=1008476804793&jrtk=3-0-1grpstlvai9js801-1grpstm01i4mv800-49e2f4ed077a7131-,"https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/united-kingdom-data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,14_IN2_KO15,29_IP2.htm",2
